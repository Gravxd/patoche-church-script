# patoche-church-script
This is a script i designed to work with Patoche's Church MLO as it had changeable entity sets. He did include a script with the purchase however it was generally un-optimised/vulnerable to easy event exploits.

This script is designed specifically for the LS interior of his map, I know it comes with 3/4 different ones but we only used the LS one.
You will require his MLO for this to work - you can get it from [his tebex](https://patoche-mapping.tebex.io/package/6359789) (this is not an endorsement or ad of his page, just credit to the creator of the mod)

You will need [ox_lib](https://github.com/overextended/ox_lib/releases) for this resource to work.

The command to change interiors is `/churchinterior` and the required ace permission is `command.churchinterior`
